# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

  Your answer:  git is the local control version on the local computer that can be edited and such, then the difference between git and github is that github is on the remote web.

  Researched answer:  git is a modern version control , that basically means it tracks changes and can control who adds code to the main, I think it is called the 'source of truth', part of the code. And Github is a cloud based system that allows storage and distribution of your git repositories, just an easier place to manage your git



2. What types of evaluations will return a Boolean value?

  Your answer:
  comparisons and booleans, the only things that I can really think of are things that would be in if statements, and those are compared to determine whether they are true or false, and those comparisons are things like ==, ===, >. <. true, false, !

  Researched answer:

There are equality operators, the loose, ==, and the strict, ===, There are also relational operators and Logical operators. Logical operators are similar to logic gates in electronics, AND, OR, NAND, NOR, etc.

3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

  Your answer: An index is the location of something located in an array or within a string. value is the actual something that is at the location. So in myFoodArray["tofu", "Beans", "bananas"] "tofu" is at index position 0 and the value of it is "tofu"

  Researched answer:

  index is a read only property, that contains the position within a string or array
  value is what actually comprises the data, like Booleans, Strings, Arrays, numbers


4. What is iteration?

  Your answer:
  an iteration is generally what it is called when a loop runs through one time

  Researched answer:

an iteration is the method in which one cycle of a loop is completed, or each element is accessed once


5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer:

  Driver: The one who is actually typing the code and doing the work
  Navigator: The one who is helping create the ideas for the code, watching the driver for mistakes.

  Researched answer:
Driver writes the code
Navigator, or observer, reviews the code as it is typed in and also considers the strategic direction of the work, while watching for areas to condense the code and potential problems in the future.


6. What is something we did in class this week you found helpful?  

  Your answer:

  Pair programming is good for getting to know people, going over github a lot is really helpful to develop that muscle memory and learn the flow of github.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. GitHub pull request:
a request to show your proposed changes to the main branch and have them be merged into the main branch

2. Higher Order Functions:
Functions that use other functions as inputs or use them as a part of themself in order to minimize the repetition

3. Jest: Jest is a testing framework that helps to make sure that code runs the way it is supposed to

4. Objects: An object is a variable or constant that has specifically designated values that are added in the declaration of the variable or constant

5. Classes: classes are templates for objects that you can call on and pass in the values, so you can create multiple instances and pass in different values.
